abstract = {The second part of this work focuses on the application of the concept of plasma condensation to large coronal loops. In contrast to the short loops analyzed in M¨ uller et al. (2003a), these models can more easily be com- pared to SOHO and TRACE observations. From our numerical calculations of coronal loops we find several classes of time-dependent solutions (static, periodic, ir- regular), depending on the spatial dependence of a tempo- rally constant energy deposition in the loop. One of these classes is in remarkably close agreement with the features observed with TRACE, described by Schrijver (2001): Emission in CIV (154.8 nm), developing initially near the loop tops, cool plasma sliding down on both sides of the loop, downflow velocities of up to 100 km/s, and a downward acceleration which is substantially reduced with respect to the solar surface gravity. Furthermore, these results also offer an explanation for the observa- tions of De Groof et al. (2003a,b). In contrast to earlier models, we suggest that the process of catastrophic cool- ing does not have to be initiated by a drastic decrease of the loop heating. It can also result from a loss of equi- librium at the loop apex which is a natural consequence if the loop is heated predominantly at the footpoints, but constant},

Specific results of particular relevance to ITER include: inner wall SOL transport studies that have led, together with results from other experiments, to the change of the detailed shape of the inner wall in ITER; runaway electron studies showing that the critical electric field required for runaway generation is much higher than predicted from collisional theory; core tungsten impurity transport studies reveal that tungsten accumulation is naturally avoided in typical C-Mod conditions.},

abstract = {Power exhaust in future fusion devices is critical and operation with a detached divertor is foreseen for ITER and DEMO. The evolution of detachment in nitrogen seeded H-mode discharges at ASDEX Upgrade is categorized in four phases. Complete detachment of the outer target is found to be correlated with a strongly localized radiation at the X-point and a pressure loss at the pedestal top at almost constant core plasma pressure. SOLPS modeling shows that enhanced radial transport in the divertor region is necessary to reconcile the experimental profiles with the simulations. The modeling supports the experimental observation of the correlation of complete detachment with an X-point radiation and a reduction of the pedestal top pressure. A remaining discrepancy are significantly lower neutral densities in the divertor compared to experiment. The effects of wall pumping, the particle reflection model and the boundary conditions on the plasma solution are discussed.},

The$\backslash$ncode runs without drifts and includes either C or Be as impurity, but$\backslash$nnot W, assuming that the W targets have been coated with Be via main$\backslash$nchamber migration. The simulations reproduce reasonably well the$\backslash$nobserved particle flux detachment as density is raised in both JET-C and$\backslash$nJET-ILW experiments and can better match the experimental in-out$\backslash$ndivertor target power asymmetry if the heat flux entering the outer$\backslash$ndivertor is artificially set at around 2-3 times that entering the inner$\backslash$ndivertor. A careful comparison between different sets of atomic physics$\backslash$nprocesses used in EIRENE shows that the detachment modelled by$\backslash$nEDGE2D-EIRENE relies only on an increase of the particle sinks and not$\backslash$non a decrease of the ionization source. For the rollover and the$\backslash$nbeginning of the partially detached phase, the particle losses by$\backslash$nperpendicular transport and the molecular activated recombination$\backslash$nprocesses are mainly involved. For a deeper detachment with significant$\backslash$ntarget ion flux reduction, volume recombination appears to be the main$\backslash$ncontributor. The elastic molecule-ion collisions are also important to$\backslash$nprovide good neutral confinement in the divertor and thus stabilize the$\backslash$nsimulations at low electron temperature (T-e), when the sink terms are$\backslash$nstrong. Comparison between EDGE2D-EIRENE and SOLPS4.3 simulations of the$\backslash$ndensity ramp in C shows similar detachment trends, but the importance of$\backslash$nthe elastic ion-molecule collisions is reduced in SOLPS4.3. Both codes$\backslash$nsuggest that any process capable of increasing the neutral confinement$\backslash$nin the divertor should help to improve the modelling of the detachment.$\backslash$nA further outcome of this work has been to demonstrate that key JET$\backslash$ndivertor diagnostic signals-Langmuir probe T-e and bolometric$\backslash$ntomographic reconstructions-are running beyond the limit of validity in$\backslash$nhigh recycling and detached conditions and cannot be reliably used for$\backslash$ncode validation. The simulations do, however, reproduce the trend of the$\backslash$nevolution of the line integrated bolometer chord measurements. The$\backslash$ncomparison between the code results and high-n Balmer line radiation$\backslash$nintensity profiles confirms that a strong volume recombination is$\backslash$npresent during the experimental detachment and may play a role in this$\backslash$nprocess, as suggested by the code.},

abstract = {The distribution of particles and power to plasma-facing components is of key importance in the design of next-generation fusion devices. Power and particle decay lengths have been measured in a number of MAST L-mode and H-mode discharges in order to determine their parametric dependencies, by fitting power and particle flux profiles measured by divertor Langmuir probes, to a convolution of an exponential decay and a Gaussian function. In all discharges analysed, it is found that exponential decay lengths mapped to the midplane are mostly dependent on separatrix electron density (n 0.65??015e, sep L-mode, (n 0.76??019e, sep H-mode) and plasma current (I p-0.36??011 L-mode, I -105??0.18p H-mode) (or parallel connection length). The widths of the convolved Gaussian functions have been used to derive an approximate diffusion coefficient, which is found to vary from 1 m2/s to 7 m2/s, and is systematically lower in H-mode compared with L-mode.

This increases the plasma-wetted area by 2-3 times over all flux-expansion-only methods (e.g., plate near main X point, plate tilting, X divertor, and snowflake), decreases parallel heat flux and hence plasma temperature at plate, and increases connection length by 2-5 times.

abstract = {The ability to exhaust the plasma power loss from a large tokamak onto material walls surrounding the plasma has been perceived to be a large obstacle to the successful production of a fusion power reactor in the past. There have been tremendous strides in understanding the physics relevant to this power exhaust over the past five years. This improvement in understanding has arisen because of both improved diagnostics of the plasma outside the last closed flux surface, and because of improved two dimensional computer models of this plasma. This understanding has led to innovative plasma solutions that reduce the power load to the divertor region of ITER to levels that are acceptable for a successful engineering design of the diverters. These plasma solutions have been realized in the devices that are active today. Analysis using the improved plasma models also indicates that particle control, both of fuel and impurity particles, is adequate for successful operation of ITER. This paper presents the current status of both the experimental and theoretical understanding of the plasma, neutral and atomic physics relevant to the plasma at the edge of fusion devices. Since understanding of the subject of this paper is progressing rapidly, we should emphasize that this paper was written in the spring of 1998 and, as such, presents the status of the subject at that time.},

The fall in intensity of the H2 Fulcher lines with distance from the divertor plates was reproduced by calculation using a neutral transport and a collisional radiative model code.

abstract = {A comprehensive investigation has been performed of the static and dynamic behaviour of detached recombining plasmas in the linear divertor plasma simulator NAGDIS-II. For stationary plasma detachment, the transition from electron-ion recombination (EIR) to molecular activated recombination (MAR) has been observed by injecting hydrogen gas into high density helium plasmas. The particle loss rate due to MAR is found to be comparable to that of EIR. Experiments have also been performed by the injection of a plasma heat pulse produced by RF heating into the detached helium plasma to demonstrate the dynamic behaviour of volumetric plasma recombination. Negative spikes in the Balmer series line emission were observed and found to be similar to the so called negative ELM observed in tokamak divertors. Observed Balmer spectra were analysed in detail using the collisional radiative model. A rapid increase of the ion flux to the target plate was observed associated with the re-ionization of the highly excited atoms generated by EIR.},

The contribution is restricted to deuterium fuelled, ohmic plasmas for which the ▽B drift is directed away from the X-point of lower single-null, open diverted equilibria with fixed elongation and triangularity. Unlike more conventional diverted equilibria, however, the configurations described are characterized by both a very short divertor poloidal depth on a vertical target and a very long poloidal depth on a horizontal target. Results are presented from density ramp discharges in which the outer (high poloidal depth) divertor is already in the high recycling regime at the start of the density ramp and in which varying degrees of detachment are obtained depending on the magnitude of the imposed outer divertor flux expansion. In contrast, the inner divertor remains in the large part attached for all densities.},

In ohmic and H-mode discharges larger compression ratios and enrichment factors as compared to divertor I have been found. With the new divertor configuration both quantities depend on the heating power and deteriorate with divertor detachment.

abstract = {The stability of the radiation front in the scrape-off layer (SOL) of a tokamak is studied with a one-dimensional fluid code; the time-dependent transport equations are solved in the direction parallel to a magnetic field line. As the energy from the core into the SOL plasma is reduced, stable attached solutions change into stable detached solutions. Whenever such stable detached states are attained, the strong radiation front is in contact with or at a small distance from the divertor target. When the input energy is decreased further and total losses become larger than the input power, the radiation front starts to move towards the X-point, cooling the SOL plasma. In such a case, no solutions for the radiation front resting in the divertor channel are observed in our parameter space. This qualitatively corresponds to the results of tokamak divertor experiments which show the movement of the radiation front.},

A simple analytic model, the 'two-point' model, is introduced early in the paper and provides a framework for comparison of the experimental results, drawn from many machines, with simply derived expectations.

A full finite aspect-ratio geometry is retained and has important effects. Thermal fronts are shown to require either localization of the source terms or density control, to be stable against parallel motion. The edge density range over which the front is naturally localized to the divertor leg is shown to be rather small.
