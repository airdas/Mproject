@article{Hutchinson1994,
abstract = {A non-linear analysis is presented of localized regions of strong divergence of parallel heat flux-thermal fronts-in the edge and scrape-off layers of tokamaks. The phenomena of divertor detachment and MARFEs are discussed in terms of one dimensional thermal conduction in the parallel co-ordinate, but retaining cross-field transport power divergence and radiation as source terms. A full finite aspect-ratio geometry is retained and has important effects. Thermal fronts are shown to require either localization of the source terms or density control, to be stable against parallel motion. The edge density range over which the front is naturally localized to the divertor leg is shown to be rather small. The size, stability and preferred position of MARFEs are predicted and are in agreement with experiment},

abstract = {Analysis of the experimental data from tokamaks and linear divertor simulators leads to the conclusion that plasma recombination is a crucial element of plasma detachment. Different mechanisms of plasma recombination relevant to the experimental conditions of the tokamak scrape-off layer (SOL) and divertor simulators are considered. The physics of Molecular Activated Recombination (MAR) involving vibrationally excited molecular hydrogen are discussed. Although conventional Electron–Ion Recombination (EIR) alone can strongly alter the plasma parameters, MAR impact can be substantial for both tokamakSOLplasma and divertor simulators. Investigation of the effects of EIR on the plasma flow in divertor simulators shows that due to the balances of (a) energytransport and electron cooling, and (b) the plasma flow and recombination, that EIR extinguishes the simulator plasma at an electron temperature about 0.15 eV.},

abstract = {This paper presents an overview of recent highlights from research on Alcator C-Mod. Significant progress has been made across all research areas over the last two years, with particular emphasis on divertor physics and power handling, plasma–material interaction studies, edge localized mode-suppressed pedestal dynamics, core transport and turbulence, and RF heating and current drive utilizing ion cyclotron and lower hybrid tools. Specific results of particular relevance to ITER include: inner wall SOL transport studies that have led, together with results from other experiments, to the change of the detailed shape of the inner wall in ITER; runaway electron studies showing that the critical electric field required for runaway generation is much higher than predicted from collisional theory; core tungsten impurity transport studies reveal that tungsten accumulation is naturally avoided in typical C-Mod conditions.},

@article{D.A.N.Muller2014,
abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

@article{Pitcher1999,
abstract = {The physics of diverters in tokamaks is reviewed, primarily from an experimental point of view, although where possible simple analytic modelling is included. The paper covers the four main subject areas at issue in divertor research: (1) the wide dispersal of plasma power exhausted from the main plasma, (2) the production of sufficiently high gas pressures in the vicinity of pump ducts to enable the removal of fuel and helium ('ash') gas from the system, (3) the elimination or reduction of impurity production and (4) the screening of impurities produced, or intentionally added, at the plasma boundary from the plasma core. A simple analytic model, the 'two-point' model, is introduced early in the paper and provides a framework for comparison of the experimental results, drawn from many machines, with simply derived expectations. Conclusions regarding the direction of future research priorities are made.},

@article{Wischmeier2009,
abstract = {A qualitative as well as quantitative simulation of experimentally observed plasma parameters in the detached regime proves to be difficult for several tokamaks. A series of ohmic discharges have been performed in ASDEX Upgrade and DIII-D at as similar as possible plasma parameters and at different line averaged densities, over(n, ̄)e. The experimental data represent a set of well diagnosed discharges against which numerical simulations are compared. For the numerical modelling the fluid-code B2.5 coupled to the Monte Carlo neutrals transport code EIRENE is used. Only the combination of effects, such as geometry, drift terms, neutral conductance, increased radial transport and divertor target composition explains a significant fraction of the experimentally observed ion fluxes, $\Gamma$t, to the inner and outer target plates as a function of over(n, ̄)e in ASDEX Upgrade. The relative importance of the mechanisms leading to detachment differ in DIII-D and ASDEX Upgrade. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.},
