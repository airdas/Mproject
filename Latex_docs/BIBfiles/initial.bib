Significant progress has been made across all research areas over the last two years, with particular emphasis on divertor physics and power handling, plasmaâ€“material interaction studies, edge localized mode-suppressed pedestal dynamics, core transport and turbulence, and RF heating and current drive utilizing ion cyclotron and lower hybrid tools. Specific results of particular relevance to ITER include: inner wall SOL transport studies that have led, together with results from other experiments, to the change of the detailed shape of the inner wall in ITER; runaway electron studies showing that the critical electric field required for runaway generation is much higher than predicted from collisional theory; core tungsten impurity transport studies reveal that tungsten accumulation is naturally avoided in typical C-Mod conditions.},

abstract = {Power exhaust in future fusion devices is critical and operation with a detached divertor is foreseen for ITER and DEMO. The evolution of detachment in nitrogen seeded H-mode discharges at ASDEX Upgrade is categorized in four phases. Complete detachment of the outer target is found to be correlated with a strongly localized radiation at the X-point and a pressure loss at the pedestal top at almost constant core plasma pressure. SOLPS modeling shows that enhanced radial transport in the divertor region is necessary to reconcile the experimental profiles with the simulations. The modeling supports the experimental observation of the correlation of complete detachment with an X-point radiation and a reduction of the pedestal top pressure. A remaining discrepancy are significantly lower neutral densities in the divertor compared to experiment. The effects of wall pumping, the particle reflection model and the boundary conditions on the plasma solution are discussed.},

The$\backslash$ncode runs without drifts and includes either C or Be as impurity, but$\backslash$nnot W, assuming that the W targets have been coated with Be via main$\backslash$nchamber migration. The simulations reproduce reasonably well the$\backslash$nobserved particle flux detachment as density is raised in both JET-C and$\backslash$nJET-ILW experiments and can better match the experimental in-out$\backslash$ndivertor target power asymmetry if the heat flux entering the outer$\backslash$ndivertor is artificially set at around 2-3 times that entering the inner$\backslash$ndivertor. A careful comparison between different sets of atomic physics$\backslash$nprocesses used in EIRENE shows that the detachment modelled by$\backslash$nEDGE2D-EIRENE relies only on an increase of the particle sinks and not$\backslash$non a decrease of the ionization source. For the rollover and the$\backslash$nbeginning of the partially detached phase, the particle losses by$\backslash$nperpendicular transport and the molecular activated recombination$\backslash$nprocesses are mainly involved. For a deeper detachment with significant$\backslash$ntarget ion flux reduction, volume recombination appears to be the main$\backslash$ncontributor. The elastic molecule-ion collisions are also important to$\backslash$nprovide good neutral confinement in the divertor and thus stabilize the$\backslash$nsimulations at low electron temperature (T-e), when the sink terms are$\backslash$nstrong. Comparison between EDGE2D-EIRENE and SOLPS4.3 simulations of the$\backslash$ndensity ramp in C shows similar detachment trends, but the importance of$\backslash$nthe elastic ion-molecule collisions is reduced in SOLPS4.3. Both codes$\backslash$nsuggest that any process capable of increasing the neutral confinement$\backslash$nin the divertor should help to improve the modelling of the detachment.$\backslash$nA further outcome of this work has been to demonstrate that key JET$\backslash$ndivertor diagnostic signals-Langmuir probe T-e and bolometric$\backslash$ntomographic reconstructions-are running beyond the limit of validity in$\backslash$nhigh recycling and detached conditions and cannot be reliably used for$\backslash$ncode validation. The simulations do, however, reproduce the trend of the$\backslash$nevolution of the line integrated bolometer chord measurements. The$\backslash$ncomparison between the code results and high-n Balmer line radiation$\backslash$nintensity profiles confirms that a strong volume recombination is$\backslash$npresent during the experimental detachment and may play a role in this$\backslash$nprocess, as suggested by the code.},

L-mode experiments with N2 seeding have been conducted at both ASDEX Upgrade and JET for benchmarking the critically important impurity radiation models in edge fluid codes. In both machines, particle and power loads are observed to first reduce at the inner target, and only then at the outer target. The outer divertor cools down with increasing N seeding rate, evolving from low-recycling conditions to a regime with peak temperature of 8-10 eV in both devices. First SOLPS5.0 simulations of N2 seeding in ASDEX Upgrade geometry show a similar in-out asymmetry in the effect of impurity radiation when drifts are activated in the simulations. ?? 2013 Euratom.

In all discharges analysed, it is found that exponential decay lengths mapped to the midplane are mostly dependent on separatrix electron density (n 0.65??015e, sep L-mode, (n 0.76??019e, sep H-mode) and plasma current (I p-0.36??011 L-mode, I -105??0.18p H-mode) (or parallel connection length).

The model is used to predict the scaling of the H-mode access power, PLâ€“H, with magnetic and plasma variables. The predictions are in good agreement with the experimental scaling of PLâ€“H with plasma size, density, magnetic field and edge safety factor (plasma current). They are also qualitatively consistent with the dependence of PLâ€“H on ion mass and charge, limiter versus divertor plasmas, single versus double null configurations, the divertor leg length and Hâ€“L versus Lâ€“H hysteresis. Most notably, the model explains the appearance of the minimum in PLâ€“H with plasma density (in terms of the transition between sheath limited and conduction limited scrape-off layer (SOL) transport) and correctly predicts the scaling of the density minimum with magnetic field and Greenwald number. Finally, the effect of toroidal field reversal is included by making the normalized correlation length of the eddy and maximum safety factor in the edge-SOL layer functions of B Ã—âˆ‡B direction.},

abstract = {Fusion ignition, on the one hand, and particle and power exhaust, on the other, impose often conflicting criteria on the plasma scenario - the former requiring the plasma to be sufficiently heated, fuelled and confined, the latter the helium ash, impurity ions and the total input + fusion power to be removed without undue damage to the reactor itself, specifically its plasma facing components (PFCs) - necessitating an optimization of the latter to attain the optimum fusion gain for a given reactor design. Foremost among these problems is the issue of power exhaust, including both steady-state and transient heat loads on PFCs. This review examines the various strategies of reducing plasma loads on PFCs at the minimum penalty to the performance of a fusion reactor, specifically ITER, and attempts to quantify the impact of a given PFC limit in terms of the relative change to the fusion gain factor compared to the no-limit value. {\textcopyright} 2009 W.

With small changes in poloidal coils and currents for standard divertors, the SXD allows the largest divertor plate radius inside toroidal field coils. This increases the plasma-wetted area by 2-3 times over all flux-expansion-only methods (e.g., plate near main X point, plate tilting, X divertor, and snowflake), decreases parallel heat flux and hence plasma temperature at plate, and increases connection length by 2-5 times. Examples of high-power-density fusion devices enabled by SXD are discussed; the most promising near-term device is a 100 MW modular compact fusion neutron source "battery" small enough to fit inside a conventional fission blanket.},

abstract = {The ability to exhaust the plasma power loss from a large tokamak onto material walls surrounding the plasma has been perceived to be a large obstacle to the successful production of a fusion power reactor in the past. There have been tremendous strides in understanding the physics relevant to this power exhaust over the past five years. This improvement in understanding has arisen because of both improved diagnostics of the plasma outside the last closed flux surface, and because of improved two dimensional computer models of this plasma. This understanding has led to innovative plasma solutions that reduce the power load to the divertor region of ITER to levels that are acceptable for a successful engineering design of the diverters. These plasma solutions have been realized in the devices that are active today. Analysis using the improved plasma models also indicates that particle control, both of fuel and impurity particles, is adequate for successful operation of ITER. This paper presents the current status of both the experimental and theoretical understanding of the plasma, neutral and atomic physics relevant to the plasma at the edge of fusion devices. Since understanding of the subject of this paper is progressing rapidly, we should emphasize that this paper was written in the spring of 1998 and, as such, presents the status of the subject at that time.},

abstract = {The B2-Eirene code package was developed to give better insight into the physics in the scrape-off layer (SOL), which is defined as the region of open field-lines intersecting walls. The SOL is characterised by the competition of parallel and perpendicular transport defining by this a 2D system. The description of the plasma-wall interaction due to the existence of walls and atomic processes are necessary ingredients for an understanding of the scrape-off layer. This paper concentrates on understanding the basic physics by combining the results of the code with experiments and analytical models or estimates. This work will mainly focus on divertor tokamaks, but most of the arguments and principles can be easily adapted also to other concepts like island divertors in stellarators or limiter devices. The paper presents the basic equations for the plasma transport and the basic models for the neutral transport. This defines the basic ingredients for the SOLPS (Scrape-Off Layer Plasma Simulator) code package. A first level of understanding is approached for pure hydrogenic plasmas based both on simple models and simulations with B2-Eirene neglecting drifts and currents. The influence of neutral transport on the different operation regimes is here the main topic. This will finish with time-dependent phenomena for the pure plasma, so-called Edge Localised Modes (ELMs). Then, the influence of impurities on the SOL plasma is discussed. For the understanding of impurity physics in the SOL one needs a rather complex combination of different aspects. The impurity production process has to be understood, then the effects of impurities in terms of radiation losses have to be included and finally impurity transport is necessary. This will be introduced with rising complexity starting with simple estimates, analysing then the detailed parallel force balance and the flow pattern of impurities. Using this, impurity compression and radiation instabilities will be studied. This part ends, combining all the elements introduced before, with specific, detailed results from different machines. Then, the effect of drifts and currents is introduced and their consequences presented. Finally, some work on deriving scaling laws for the anomalous turbulent transport based on automatic edge transport code fitting procedures will be described. {\textcopyright} 2006 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co.

We have carried out numerical calculations of coronal loops and find several classes of time-dependent solutions (static, periodic, irregular), depending on the spatial distribution of a temporally constant energy deposition in the loop. Dynamic loops exhibit recurrent plasma condensations, accompanied by high-speed downflows and transient brightenings of transition region lines, in good agreement with features observed with TRACE. Furthermore, these results also offer an explanation for the recent EIT observations of De Groof et al. (2004) of moving bright blobs in large coronal loops. In contrast to earlier models, we suggest that the process of catastrophic cooling is not initiated by a drastic decrease of the total loop heating but rather results from a loss of equilibrium at the loop apex as a natural consequence of heating concentrated at the footpoints of the loop, but constant in time.},

abstract = {This paper presents the results of a preliminary assessment conducted to estimate the thermal response and erosion lifetime of the ITER divertor targets clad either with carbon-fibre composite or tungsten during type I ELMs. The one-dimensional thermal/erosion model, used for the analyses, is briefly described. It includes all the key surface heat transfer processes such as evaporation, melting, and radiation, and their interaction with the bulk thermal response, and it is based on an implicit finite-difference scheme, which allows for temperature-dependent material properties. The cases analysed clarify the influence of several ELM parameters on the heat transfer and erosion processes at the target (i.e. characteristic plasma ELM energy loss from the pedestal, fraction of the energy reaching the divertor, broadening of the strike-points during ELMs, duration and waveform of the ELM heat load) and design/material parameters (i.e. inclination of the target, type and thickness of the armour material, and for tungsten only, fraction of the melt layer loss). Comparison is made between cases where all ELMs are characterized by the same fixed averaged parameters, and cases where instead the characteristic parameters of each ELM are evaluated in a random fashion by using a standard Monte Carlo technique, based on distributions of some of the variables of interest derived from experiments in today's machines. Although uncertainties rule out providing firm quantitative predictions, the results of this study are useful to illustrate trends. Based on the results, the implications on the design and operation are discussed and priorities are determined for the R{\&}D needed to reduce the remaining uncertainties.},

Results are presented from density ramp discharges in which the outer (high poloidal depth) divertor is already in the high recycling regime at the start of the density ramp and in which varying degrees of detachment are obtained depending on the magnitude of the imposed outer divertor flux expansion. In contrast, the inner divertor remains in the large part attached for all densities.},

abstract = {The stability of the radiation front in the scrape-off layer (SOL) of a tokamak is studied with a one-dimensional fluid code; the time-dependent transport equations are solved in the direction parallel to a magnetic field line. As the energy from the core into the SOL plasma is reduced, stable attached solutions change into stable detached solutions. Whenever such stable detached states are attained, the strong radiation front is in contact with or at a small distance from the divertor target. When the input energy is decreased further and total losses become larger than the input power, the radiation front starts to move towards the X-point, cooling the SOL plasma. In such a case, no solutions for the radiation front resting in the divertor channel are observed in our parameter space. This qualitatively corresponds to the results of tokamak divertor experiments which show the movement of the radiation front.},

abstract = {The experimental characteristics of divertor detachment in the JET tokamak with the Mark I pumped divertor are presented for ohmic, L mode and ELMy H mode experiments with the main emphasis on discharges with deuterium fuelling only. The range over which divertor detachment is observed for the various regimes, as well as the influence of divertor configuration, direction of the toroidal field, divertor target material and active pumping on detachment, will be described. The observed detachment characteristics, such as the existence of a considerable electron pressure drop along the field lines in the scrape-off layer (SOL), and the compatibility of the decrease in plasma flux to the divertor plate with the observed increase of neutral pressure and D-alpha emission from the divertor region, will be examined in the light of existing results from analytical and numerical models for plasma detachment. Finally, a method to evaluate the degree of detachment and the window of detachment is proposed, and all the observations of the JET Mark I divertor experiments are summarized in the light of this new quantitative definition of divertor detachment.},

abstract = {Analysis of the experimental data from tokamaks and linear divertor simulators leads to the conclusion that plasma recombination is a crucial element of plasma detachment. Different mechanisms of plasma recombination relevant to the experimental conditions of the tokamak scrape-off layer (SOL) and divertor simulators are considered. The physics of Molecular Activated Recombination (MAR) involving vibrationally excited molecular hydrogen are discussed. Although conventional Electronâ€“Ion Recombination (EIR) alone can strongly alter the plasma parameters, MAR impact can be substantial for both tokamakSOLplasma and divertor simulators. Investigation of the effects of EIR on the plasma flow in divertor simulators shows that due to the balances of (a) energytransport and electron cooling, and (b) the plasma flow and recombination, that EIR extinguishes the simulator plasma at an electron temperature about 0.15 eV.},

abstract = {The physics of divertors in tokamaks is reviewed, primarily from an experimental point of view, although where possible simple analytic modelling is included. The paper covers the four main subject areas at issue in divertor research: (1) the wide dispersal of plasma power exhausted from the main plasma, (2) the production of sufficiently high gas pressures in the vicinity of pump ducts to enable the removal of fuel and helium ('ash') gas from the system, (3) the elimination or reduction of impurity production and (4) the screening of impurities produced, or intentionally added, at the plasma boundary from the plasma core. A simple analytic model, the 'two-point' model, is introduced early in the paper and provides a framework for comparison of the experimental results, drawn from many machines, with simply derived expectations. Conclusions regarding the direction of future research priorities are made.},

The phenomena of divertor detachment and MARFEs are discussed in terms of one dimensional thermal conduction in the parallel co-ordinate, but retaining cross-field transport power divergence and radiation as source terms. A full finite aspect-ratio geometry is retained and has important effects. Thermal fronts are shown to require either localization of the source terms or density control, to be stable against parallel motion. The edge density range over which the front is naturally localized to the divertor leg is shown to be rather small. The size, stability and preferred position of MARFEs are predicted and are in agreement with experiment},
