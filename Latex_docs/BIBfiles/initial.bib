abstract = {The second part of this work focuses on the application of the concept of plasma condensation to large coronal loops. In contrast to the short loops analyzed in M¨ uller et al. (2003a), these models can more easily be com- pared to SOHO and TRACE observations. From our numerical calculations of coronal loops we find several classes of time-dependent solutions (static, periodic, ir- regular), depending on the spatial dependence of a tempo- rally constant energy deposition in the loop. One of these classes is in remarkably close agreement with the features observed with TRACE, described by Schrijver (2001): Emission in CIV (154.8 nm), developing initially near the loop tops, cool plasma sliding down on both sides of the loop, downflow velocities of up to 100 km/s, and a downward acceleration which is substantially reduced with respect to the solar surface gravity. Furthermore, these results also offer an explanation for the observa- tions of De Groof et al. (2003a,b). In contrast to earlier models, we suggest that the process of catastrophic cool- ing does not have to be initiated by a drastic decrease of the loop heating. It can also result from a loss of equi- librium at the loop apex which is a natural consequence if the loop is heated predominantly at the footpoints, but constant},

abstract = {This paper presents an overview of recent highlights from research on Alcator C-Mod. Significant progress has been made across all research areas over the last two years, with particular emphasis on divertor physics and power handling, plasma–material interaction studies, edge localized mode-suppressed pedestal dynamics, core transport and turbulence, and RF heating and current drive utilizing ion cyclotron and lower hybrid tools. Specific results of particular relevance to ITER include: inner wall SOL transport studies that have led, together with results from other experiments, to the change of the detailed shape of the inner wall in ITER; runaway electron studies showing that the critical electric field required for runaway generation is much higher than predicted from collisional theory; core tungsten impurity transport studies reveal that tungsten accumulation is naturally avoided in typical C-Mod conditions.},

abstract = {The EDGE2D-EIRENE code is applied for simulation of divertor detachment$\backslash$nduring matched density ramp experiments in high triangularity, L-mode$\backslash$nplasmas in both JET-Carbon (JET-C) and JET-ITER-Like Wall (JET-ILW). The$\backslash$ncode runs without drifts and includes either C or Be as impurity, but$\backslash$nnot W, assuming that the W targets have been coated with Be via main$\backslash$nchamber migration. The simulations reproduce reasonably well the$\backslash$nobserved particle flux detachment as density is raised in both JET-C and$\backslash$nJET-ILW experiments and can better match the experimental in-out$\backslash$ndivertor target power asymmetry if the heat flux entering the outer$\backslash$ndivertor is artificially set at around 2-3 times that entering the inner$\backslash$ndivertor. A careful comparison between different sets of atomic physics$\backslash$nprocesses used in EIRENE shows that the detachment modelled by$\backslash$nEDGE2D-EIRENE relies only on an increase of the particle sinks and not$\backslash$non a decrease of the ionization source. For the rollover and the$\backslash$nbeginning of the partially detached phase, the particle losses by$\backslash$nperpendicular transport and the molecular activated recombination$\backslash$nprocesses are mainly involved. For a deeper detachment with significant$\backslash$ntarget ion flux reduction, volume recombination appears to be the main$\backslash$ncontributor. The elastic molecule-ion collisions are also important to$\backslash$nprovide good neutral confinement in the divertor and thus stabilize the$\backslash$nsimulations at low electron temperature (T-e), when the sink terms are$\backslash$nstrong. Comparison between EDGE2D-EIRENE and SOLPS4.3 simulations of the$\backslash$ndensity ramp in C shows similar detachment trends, but the importance of$\backslash$nthe elastic ion-molecule collisions is reduced in SOLPS4.3. Both codes$\backslash$nsuggest that any process capable of increasing the neutral confinement$\backslash$nin the divertor should help to improve the modelling of the detachment.$\backslash$nA further outcome of this work has been to demonstrate that key JET$\backslash$ndivertor diagnostic signals-Langmuir probe T-e and bolometric$\backslash$ntomographic reconstructions-are running beyond the limit of validity in$\backslash$nhigh recycling and detached conditions and cannot be reliably used for$\backslash$ncode validation. The simulations do, however, reproduce the trend of the$\backslash$nevolution of the line integrated bolometer chord measurements. The$\backslash$ncomparison between the code results and high-n Balmer line radiation$\backslash$nintensity profiles confirms that a strong volume recombination is$\backslash$npresent during the experimental detachment and may play a role in this$\backslash$nprocess, as suggested by the code.},

abstract = {The distribution of particles and power to plasma-facing components is of key importance in the design of next-generation fusion devices. Power and particle decay lengths have been measured in a number of MAST L-mode and H-mode discharges in order to determine their parametric dependencies, by fitting power and particle flux profiles measured by divertor Langmuir probes, to a convolution of an exponential decay and a Gaussian function. In all discharges analysed, it is found that exponential decay lengths mapped to the midplane are mostly dependent on separatrix electron density (n 0.65??015e, sep L-mode, (n 0.76??019e, sep H-mode) and plasma current (I p-0.36??011 L-mode, I -105??0.18p H-mode) (or parallel connection length). The widths of the convolved Gaussian functions have been used to derive an approximate diffusion coefficient, which is found to vary from 1 m2/s to 7 m2/s, and is systematically lower in H-mode compared with L-mode.

Negative spikes in the Balmer series line emission were observed and found to be similar to the so called negative ELM observed in tokamak divertors. Observed Balmer spectra were analysed in detail using the collisional radiative model.

abstract = {The physics of divertors in tokamaks is reviewed, primarily from an experimental point of view, although where possible simple analytic modelling is included. The paper covers the four main subject areas at issue in divertor research: (1) the wide dispersal of plasma power exhausted from the main plasma, (2) the production of sufficiently high gas pressures in the vicinity of pump ducts to enable the removal of fuel and helium ('ash') gas from the system, (3) the elimination or reduction of impurity production and (4) the screening of impurities produced, or intentionally added, at the plasma boundary from the plasma core. A simple analytic model, the 'two-point' model, is introduced early in the paper and provides a framework for comparison of the experimental results, drawn from many machines, with simply derived expectations. Conclusions regarding the direction of future research priorities are made.},

@article{Hutchinson1994,
abstract = {A non-linear analysis is presented of localized regions of strong divergence of parallel heat flux-thermal fronts-in the edge and scrape-off layers of tokamaks. The phenomena of divertor detachment and MARFEs are discussed in terms of one dimensional thermal conduction in the parallel co-ordinate, but retaining cross-field transport power divergence and radiation as source terms. A full finite aspect-ratio geometry is retained and has important effects. Thermal fronts are shown to require either localization of the source terms or density control, to be stable against parallel motion. The edge density range over which the front is naturally localized to the divertor leg is shown to be rather small. The size, stability and preferred position of MARFEs are predicted and are in agreement with experiment},
